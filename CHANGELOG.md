# Changelog

## 0.11.0

- Replace celluloid monitor with thread based middleware for Sidekiq 4.0
- Tests no longer use use redis namespace

## 0.10.0

- Require Sidekiq 3.5
- You may use `HerokuPlatformScaler` and `HEROKU_ACCESS_TOKEN` in place of `HerkouScaler` and `HEROKU_API_KEY`
- QueueSystem#workers returns the number of engaged SK processes.
- Linear Scaling Strategy will not scale down past number of active workers. Assumes 1-1 SK process/dyno mapping.
- Calls the SideKiq quiet api when shutting down
- Count workers currently running (Joel Van Horn)
- Update gems and use RSpec expect syntax (giviger)

## 0.9.0

- CounterCacheRedis.new now takes a third parameter `worker_type`, a string used in the
  Redis cache key. Allows for caching counts for various types of workers, not just `worker`
- Support for Sidekiq 3.0
- Strategy wrapper to ignore scheduled and retrying queues. Usage:
    ``new_strategy = IgnoreScheduledAndRetrying.new(my_old_strategy)``
- LinearScalingStrategy now accepts a minimum amount of work (as a percentage of worker capacity)
  required to begin scaling up. E.g LinearScalingStrategy.new(10, 4, 0.5) will scale to one worker
  after 4*0.5 = 2 jobs are enqueued, and a maximum of 10 workers at 10*4 jobs. Old behavior is preserved
  with a default value of 0.

## 0.8.0

- Extracted caching of Heroku worker counts and added experimental Redis cache:
    ``scaler.counter_cache = Autoscaler::CounterCacheRedis.new(Sidekiq.method(:redis))``
- Now rescues Heroku::Api::Errors in addition to Excon::Errors

## 0.7.0

- Added Autoscaler::LinearScalingStrategy
- EntireQueuSystem#queued always returns an integer

## 0.6.0

- Excon errors from the Heroku API are caught be default.  See `HerokuScaler#exception_handler` to override behavior
- Client side scaling occurs after enquing the job, previously it was before.

## 0.5.0

- Experimental: `Client#set_initial_workers` to start workers on main process startup; typically:
    Autoscaler::Sidekiq::Client.add_to_chain(chain, 'default' => heroku).set_initial_workers
- Ensure that timeout is documented as being in seconds
- Convert gemspec to wildcard file selection

## 0.4.1

- Missing file from gemspec

## 0.4.0

- Experimental: The default scaling logic is contained in BinaryScalingStrategy.  A strategy object can be passed instead of timeout to the server middleware.

## 0.3.0

- Downscale method changed from busy-waiting workers to a separate monitor process
- Minimum Sidekiq version raised to 2.7 to take advantage of Worker API
- Internal refactoring
- Autoscaler::StubScaler may be used for local testing

## 0.2.1

- Separate background activity flags to avoid crosstalk between processes

## 0.2.0

- Raise minimum Sidekiq version to 2.6.1 to take advantage of Stats API
- Inspect scheduled and retry sets to see if they match `specified_queues`
- Testing: Refactor server middleware tests

## 0.1.0

- The `retry` and `scheduled` queues are now considered for shutdown
- Testing: Guard starts up an isolated redis instance

## 0.0.3

- Typo correction

## 0.0.2

- Loosen Sidekiq version dependency
- Add changelog
- Add changelog, readme, and examples to gem files list
